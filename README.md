## Abstract

Within the intelWATT project, financed by the European Union (EU), a novel high recovery Reverse Osmosis (RO), known as Hybrid Semibatch-Batch Reverse Osmosis (HSBRO), is developed for the treatment of wastewater from an electroplating facility. In this thesis, using a previously defined simulator of the process, we propose an iterative methodology for the training of Reinforcement Learning agents capable of controlling complex and dynamic industrial processes, such as HBSRO. After training and tuning hyperparameters using the RLlib distributed computing library, the agent shows the ability to learn complex control policies and achieve the objectives proposed in the reward function in more than 90% of the simulated episodes.

## Acknowledgment

This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 958454. The HSBRO simulator was developed through the collaboration of the University of Birmingham and Avvale.
