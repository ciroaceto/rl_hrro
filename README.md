# Digital Twin Optimization of electroplating wastewater treatment process

This repository gathers all the files corresponding to the development of a master thesis.

## Abstract

Within the intelWATT project, financed by the European Union (EU), a novel high recovery Reverse Osmosis (RO), known as Hybrid Semibatch-Batch Reverse Osmosis (HSBRO), is developed for the treatment of wastewater from an electroplating facility. In this thesis, using a previously defined simulator of the process, we propose an iterative methodology for the training of Reinforcement Learning agents capable of controlling complex and dynamic industrial processes, such as HBSRO. After training and tuning hyperparameters using the RLlib distributed computing library, the agent shows the ability to learn complex control policies and achieve the objectives proposed in the reward function in more than 90% of the simulated episodes.
